# nextjs-blog

There is so much more that I wanted to do.

The General styling is very poor as I did not have time to do this aspect.

It is the case that this is one of my earliest Next.js implemantaions... And I must say there are some very nice things tp sauy about the framework / environment.

My time was largely taken getting up to speed on some of the features of Next.js, as well as gettting D3, ant.design in place. And to reaquaint myself with the syntax of creating D3 visualizations. and to investigate the great components in ant.design, which I have not used before, having spent some tie looking at Material.UI. It was very nice to get the comparison of the f2 component libraies.

## Updating to New Releases

Create React App is divided into two packages:

- `create-react-app` is a global command-line utility that you use to create new projects.
- `react-scripts` is a development dependency in the generated projects (including this one).

You almost never need to update `create-react-app` itself: it delegates all the setup to `react-scripts`.
